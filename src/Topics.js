            Below you will find a collection of resources & online algebra
            lessons which we are going to cover and the relevant supporting
            worksheets that are available for download. When used in conjunction
            with the lessons that I take you through in the Videos section, this
            will give the student additional practice that can complement
            classNameroom lessons. Take a moment to browse through the library
            to find the topics, online algebra lessons and find the
            corresponding working materials. These can apply to be used for
            additional practice both at the time of teaching in the
            classNameroom, for further practice at home, or also to review and
            brush up on past lessons and concepts which the student may want to
            develop further.
