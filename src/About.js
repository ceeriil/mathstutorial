                I go by the name of Mr. Sa, and while I was originally born in
                India, I emigrated to Thailand at a young age where I grew up
                and have now been living for the last 20 years, completing all
                my education here as well, which includes a master’s degree in
                education and also hold a teaching certification and have been a
                teacher for the last 7 years now, with experience in the CBSE,
                GED, IGCSE and Manitoba curriculums. During my post-grad program
                I was selected to participate in a comparative study in
                Singapore and my final theses was written on the topic of
                Polya’s Problem Solving Techniques which is a unique approach to
                resolving problems that we all face in our lives and can be
                applied across countless scenarios.

                Something which I am very passionate about is mathematics, hence
                why I have created this website to share my love for numbers
                with others who may possibly see it as a bit more daunting than
                it should be and I love to share my knowledge with others and
                give them the support they need with this. Most people have at
                the very least a rudimentary understanding of mathematical
                concepts, but for some, this understanding can take longer to
                attain. It’s also worth mentioning that we use some aspects of
                maths in our daily lives, many times without even noticing it,
                and so I want to help others build up their own foundation and
                experience that can aid them in their future by giving them
                insight into my own thought processes that will make everything
                much easier.

              By using the right approach to tackle concepts and problems using
              a structured thought process, I have spent my time to build up
              these lessons to share with others who are looking for a little
              additional help, be it at home or in a more formal educational
              setting, and using my own personal background in education that is
              coupled with my love for anything related to numbers, you too will
              be able to benefit from these lessons.
            </p>
            <p>
              In my spare time I try to go out to see more of the world and
              explore something new, so far I have been to 14 countries and
              counting! I truly believe that travel broadens the mind and I
              encourage anyone to take any opportunity to go out and discover
              new places, you will never regret having seen and experienced
              other places, customs and cultures.

              Sharing knowledge has always been a passion of mine which is the
              main reason that I dedicate my skills and efforts to provide a
              reliable and easy to understand platform for others to be able to
              benefit from. So go ahead and give my lessons a try and you’ll be
              able to boost up your skills and knowledge in no time and can have
              a much better overview for the core concepts that form the
              foundation of education!
