I will start off by finding the Area of the walls followed by finding the area of the windows and the doors. After this step, I will subtract the area of the windows and the doors with the area of the walls\n\nQuestion) The dimensions of a room are 10m x 8m x 5m. This room has two windows each measuring 1.5m x 1m and two doors measuring 2.5m x 2m. Find the cost of whitewashing the walls of the room at 20 Baht per sq.m.\n\nThe method I use is not to let the students memorize the formula but to understand how to find it. The total surface area of a rectangular prism can be found by finding the surface area of FRONT/BACK, LEFT/RIGHT & TOP/BOTTOM and adding it. The Lateral surface area of a cuboid can be found by finding the area of FRONT/BACK & LEFT/RIGHT. \n\nI hope this video helped!  If it did, be sure to SUBSCRIBE for more content.

If you need help in how to calculate Surface Area of Triangular Prism, you are at the right place! The Total Surface Area of a Triangular Prism  can be easily found by finding the area of 2 triangles and 3 rectangles.\n\nHow to Calculate Surface Area of a Triangular Prism:\nTo find the surface area of a triangular prism we will use the technique of dividing it into different shapes, finding their surface area separately, and then adding them to get the surface area of the triangular prism.\n\nSplitting a Triangular Prism Into Different Shapes\nThere are five shapes in a triangular prism.\n\n- Firstly, we will separate the two triangles on the front and back side of the triangular prism.\n- Now, only three rectangles remain namely base rectangle, side rectangle, and slope rectangle.\n- By using the formulas of the surface area of these five shapes separately we can find the formula of the surface area of a triangular prism.\n\nTherefore, the formula is:\n\nS.A = S.A of two triangles+S.A of base rec+S.A of side rec+S.A of slope rec\n\nA=(\xbd)bh+lw+lw+lw\nWhere b is \u2018base\u2019, h is \u2018height\u2019, l is \u2018length\u2019, w is \u2018width\u2019.\n\nAPPLICATIONS OF SURFACE AREA OF TRIANGULAR PRISM\n\nSome real life applications are:\n\n- Fabric needed for the manufacturing of camping tents.\n- Paint required to coat the triangular roof.\n\nI hope this video helped!

This video will be an easy guide on how to calculate the surface area of a cylinder in just few steps by finding the area of 2 circles and the lateral surface area of the cylinder.\n\nA cylinder is any 3-dimensional shape that has 2 equal circles on both ends that are joined by a curved tube-like shape. As I have said in my online high school Math lessons, If you are asked to find the surface area of a complex shape, then divide that shape into smaller shapes and find the surface area of each shape individually then add them to get the surface area of the original shape. \n\nSplitting a Cylinder Into Different Parts:\n- Firstly, we separate the two circles on the ends of the cylinder.\n- Now, only the middle tube body of the cylinder remains. If we open this tube or make it  flat we see that the tube has a rectangular shape i.e. the tube is just a curved rectangle. \n- By using the formulas of the surface area of these shapes separately we can find the formula of the surface area of a cylinder. \n\nReal Life Examples of Surface Area of a Cylinder:\nWe need surface area of a cylinder in many daily life applications such as:\n\n- To know how much gift wrap is needed to wrap a cylindrical-shaped gift.\n- To paint or coat cylindrical-shape objects.\n- And many other applications of surface area in industrial and constructional level. \n\nI hope this video helped!

The surface area of a hemisphere can be easily found by calculating the curved surface area of a sphere + the area of flat face (circle).\n\nWhat is a \u2018Hemisphere?\nA hemisphere is half of a sphere. A sphere is a ball-shaped object. \n\nThe surface area of the hemisphere can be found by using the technique of dividing it into different shapes. Then finding their surface area and adding them to get the total surface area of a hemisphere.\n\nSplitting a Hemisphere into Different Parts\n- Firstly, we will separate the curved surface of the hemisphere. The surface area of this curved surface is half of that of a sphere. Mathematically, (4\u03c0r2)/2=2\u03c0r2.\n- Secondly, we will take the flat surface that is basically the circle or the base of the hemisphere.\n- Now by adding the formulas of the surface area of both these shapes separately we can find the formula of the surface area of the hemisphere.\n\nSurface area of hemisphere = Curved surface area + Base surface area\n\nAPPLICATIONS OF SURFACE AREA OF A HEMISPHERE:\n\n- Consider Earth. If a circle is drawn around the Earth, it would divide the Earth into two halves called hemispheres.\n- The dome of buildings is also hemisphere shaped. Its construction, paint, and decoration require the knowledge of its surface area.\n\nI hope this video helped!  If it did, be sure to SUBSCRIBE for more content.

Now, lets understand what do we mean by a scale diagram.\n\nA diagram that is an enlargement or reduction of another diagram is called a scale diagram. When the Scale diagram is smaller than the original diagram, we call it a reduction and in a reduction, the scale factor will be less than 1. The scale factor is the relationship between the matching lengths of the two diagrams.\n\nWhat is a \u2018Triangle\u2019?\nA triangle is a closed, two-dimensional figure that has three straight sides. The point where two straight lines in a triangle meet is known as the vertex. Each vertex makes an angle. So a triangle has three vertices, three angles, and three edges. Of all the three sides, the base of the triangle is any one side. The length of the line drawn perpendicular to its base that joins the vertex on the opposite side of the base is called the height or altitude of the triangle. The figure is illustrated below.\n\n1) Isosceles Triangle : Two sides of the triangle will be equal\n2) Scalene Triangle : All of the sides of the triangle will be different\n3) Equilateral Triangle : All of the sides of the triangle will be equal\n4) Acute-angled triangle : In an acute-angled triangle, all of the 3 angles in the  triangle will be acute angles, which means that all of the angles will be less than 90 degrees.\n5) Obtuse-angled triangle : In an obtuse-angled triangle, 1 of the angles will be obtuse (which means more than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees) and the remaining 2 of the angles will be acute angles (less than 90 degrees)\n6) Right-angled triangle : In a right-angled triangle, 1 of the angles will be a right angle (exactly 90 degrees) and the remaining 2 angles will be acute angles (less than 90 degrees)\n\nTo find the Scale Factor of a scale diagram, we divide the length on the scale diagram with the length on the original diagram.\n\nWhy is this important?\n- Construction workers when they construct building and bridges\n- motorists when they use maps to get around a city\n\nI hope this video helped!
