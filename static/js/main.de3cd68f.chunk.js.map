<div class=\"about-description\">\n              <p>\n                I go by the name of Mr. Sa, and while I was originally born in\n                India, I emigrated to Thailand at a young age where I grew up\n                and have now been living for the last 20 years, completing all\n                my education here as well, which includes a master’s degree in\n                education and also hold a teaching certification and have been a\n                teacher for the last 7 years now, with experience in the CBSE,\n                GED, IGCSE and Manitoba curriculums. During my post-grad program\n                I was selected to participate in a comparative study in\n                Singapore and my final theses was written on the topic of\n                Polya’s Problem Solving Techniques which is a unique approach to\n                resolving problems that we all face in our lives and can be\n                applied across countless scenarios.\n              </p>\n              <p>\n                Something which I am very passionate about is mathematics, hence\n                why I have created this website to share my love for numbers\n                with others who may possibly see it as a bit more daunting than\n                it should be and I love to share my knowledge with others and\n                give them the support they need with this. Most people have at\n                the very least a rudimentary understanding of mathematical\n                concepts, but for some, this understanding can take longer to\n                attain. It’s also worth mentioning that we use some aspects of\n                maths in our daily lives, many times without even noticing it,\n                and so I want to help others build up their own foundation and\n                experience that can aid them in their future by giving them\n                insight into my own thought processes that will make everything\n                much easier.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n          </div>\n          <div class=\"about-description\">\n            <p>\n              By using the right approach to tackle concepts and problems using\n              a structured thought process, I have spent my time to build up\n              these lessons to share with others who are looking for a little\n              additional help, be it at home or in a more formal educational\n              setting, and using my own personal background in education that is\n              coupled with my love for anything related to numbers, you too will\n              be able to benefit from these lessons.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              In my spare time I try to go out to see more of the world and\n              explore something new, so far I have been to 14 countries and\n              counting! I truly believe that travel broadens the mind and I\n              encourage anyone to take any opportunity to go out and discover\n              new places, you will never regret having seen and experienced\n              other places, customs and cultures.\n            </p>\n            <p>\n              Sharing knowledge has always been a passion of mine which is the\n              main reason that I dedicate my skills and efforts to provide a\n              reliable and easy to understand platform for others to be able to\n              benefit from.

In this step\n                your focus should be on considering the plans and not carrying\n                them out. For instance, to figure how many people or things were\n                left in the situation, it is important to know how many people\n                or things were there to begin with.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <h3>3.

After you have sub\n                goal figured out, it will be easier to get the final solution.\n                Do not miss out any step, for if you miss out any, you might\n                have a hard time solving the problem.\n              </p>\n            </div>\n            <div>\n              <h3>4.

You must check the context throughout so that nothing\n                is left behind. Most individuals do not review the context after\n                getting an answer which results them in missing out on small\n                details that may impact the final solution.

If you need help in how to calculate Surface Area of Triangular Prism, you are at the right place! The Total Surface Area of a Triangular Prism  can be easily found by finding the area of 2 triangles and 3 rectangles.\\n\\nHow to Calculate Surface Area of a Triangular Prism:\\nTo find the surface area of a triangular prism we will use the technique of dividing it into different shapes, finding their surface area separately, and then adding them to get the surface area of the triangular prism.\\n\\nSplitting a Triangular Prism Into Different Shapes\\nThere are five shapes in a triangular prism.\\n\\n- Firstly, we will separate the two triangles on the front and back side of the triangular prism.\\n- Now, only three rectangles remain namely base rectangle, side rectangle, and slope rectangle.\\n- By using the formulas of the surface area of these five shapes separately we can find the formula of the surface area of a triangular prism.\\n\\nTherefore, the formula is:\\n\\nS.A = S.A of two triangles+S.A of base rec+S.A of side rec+S.A of slope rec\\n\\nA=(\\u00bd)bh+lw+lw+lw\\nWhere b is \\u2018base\\u2019, h is \\u2018height\\u2019, l is \\u2018length\\u2019, w is \\u2018width\\u2019.\\n\\nAPPLICATIONS OF SURFACE AREA OF TRIANGULAR PRISM\\n\\nSome real life applications are:\\n\\n- Fabric needed for the manufacturing of camping tents.\\n- Paint required to coat the triangular roof.\\n\\nI hope this video helped!

This video will be an easy guide on how to calculate the surface area of a cylinder in just few steps by finding the area of 2 circles and the lateral surface area of the cylinder.\\n\\nA cylinder is any 3-dimensional shape that has 2 equal circles on both ends that are joined by a curved tube-like shape. As I have said in my online high school Math lessons, If you are asked to find the surface area of a complex shape, then divide that shape into smaller shapes and find the surface area of each shape individually then add them to get the surface area of the original shape. \\n\\nSplitting a Cylinder Into Different Parts:\\n- Firstly, we separate the two circles on the ends of the cylinder.\\n- Now, only the middle tube body of the cylinder remains. If we open this tube or make it  flat we see that the tube has a rectangular shape i.e. the tube is just a curved rectangle. \\n- By using the formulas of the surface area of these shapes separately we can find the formula of the surface area of a cylinder. \\n\\nReal Life Examples of Surface Area of a Cylinder:\\nWe need surface area of a cylinder in many daily life applications such as:\\n\\n- To know how much gift wrap is needed to wrap a cylindrical-shaped gift.\\n- To paint or coat cylindrical-shape objects.\\n- And many other applications of surface area in industrial and constructional level. \\n\\nI hope this video helped!

The scale factor is the relationship between the matching lengths of the two diagrams.\\n\\nWhat is a \\u2018Triangle\\u2019?\\nA triangle is a closed, two-dimensional figure that has three straight sides. The point where two straight lines in a triangle meet is known as the vertex. Each vertex makes an angle. So a triangle has three vertices, three angles, and three edges. Of all the three sides, the base of the triangle is any one side. The length of the line drawn perpendicular to its base that joins the vertex on the opposite side of the base is called the height or altitude of the triangle. The figure is illustrated below.\\n\\n1) Isosceles Triangle : Two sides of the triangle will be equal\\n2) Scalene Triangle : All of the sides of the triangle will be different\\n3) Equilateral Triangle : All of the sides of the triangle will be equal\\n4) Acute-angled triangle : In an acute-angled triangle, all of the 3 angles in the  triangle will be acute angles, which means that all of the angles will be less than 90 degrees.\\n5) Obtuse-angled triangle : In an obtuse-angled triangle, 1 of the angles will be obtuse (which means more than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees) and the remaining 2 of the angles will be acute angles (less than 90 degrees)\\n6) Right-angled triangle : In a right-angled triangle, 1 of the angles will be a right angle (exactly 90 degrees) and the remaining 2 angles will be acute angles (less than 90 degrees)\\n\\nTo find the Scale Factor of a scale diagram, we divide the length on the scale diagram with the length on the original diagram.\\n\\nWhy is this important?\\n- Construction workers when they construct building and bridges\\n- motorists when they use maps to get around a city\\n\\nI hope this video helped!

The point where two straight lines in a triangle meet is known as the vertex. Each vertex makes an angle. So a triangle has three vertices, three angles, and three edges. Of all the three sides, the base of the triangle is any one side. The length of the line drawn perpendicular to its base that joins the vertex on the opposite side of the base is called the height or altitude of the triangle. The figure is illustrated below.\\n\\n1) Isosceles Triangle : Two sides of the triangle will be equal\\n2) Scalene Triangle : All of the sides of the triangle will be different\\n3) Equilateral Triangle : All of the sides of the triangle will be equal\\n\\nI hope this video helped!
